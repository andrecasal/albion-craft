# Pure Arbitrage

- Single-Item Teleport ✅ teleport needs proper calculation
- Order-Book Teleport
- Order-Book Transport

Refining

- Focus Refining - Buy raw → refine with focus (15-45% return) → sell refined
- No-Focus Refining - Buy raw → refine without focus → sell (city bonus only)
- Bank Refining - Use banked raw materials → refine → sell

Crafting

- Simple Craft - Buy materials → craft → sell
- Focus Crafting - Craft with focus for material return
- Vertical Craft - Buy raw → refine → craft → sell
- Black Market Craft - Craft specifically for BM buy orders
- Get items in bank in each town -> Buy raw materials -> teleport -> refine
  materials -> teleport -> craft -> teleport -> sell

  materials -> teleport -> craft -> transport -> sell

Enchanting

- Buy base item + runes/souls/relics → enchant → sell
- Buy base item + runes/souls/relics → enchant → teleport → sell
- Buy base item + runes/souls/relics → enchant → transport → sell

Transmutation

- Artifact Transmute Up - Runes → Souls → Relics
- Material Transmutation - Cross-type material conversion

Journals

- Journal Flipping - Buy empty → craft to fill → sell filled

Salvaging

- Salvage Arbitrage - Buy cheap equipment → salvage → sell materials

Farming/Production

- Crop Farming - Seeds → crops → sell or process into food
- Animal Farming - Babies → grown → sell or process
- Butchering - Buy animals → butcher → sell meat/hide

Composite/Hybrid

- Optimal Path Finder - Given starting inventory + location, find best profit
  path

Probably NOT worth implementing:

- Single-item transport (dominated by teleport)
- Gathering (hard to model time, depends on gathering gear/specs)
- Faction warfare (requires PvP activity)
- Island production (very slow ROI)
- Re-rolling (Random-Number-Generator-dependent)
